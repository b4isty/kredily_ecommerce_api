# Deploy a Django project to Heroku

Create a Procfile in the project root directory. 
The Procfile is a text file that tells Heroku what command to run to start your application.
Here is an example Procfile for a Django project:
Copy code
```bash 
web: gunicorn myproject.wsgi --log-file -
```
This Procfile specifies that the web process type should be run using the gunicorn application server, 
and the WSGI file for the Django project should be used as the entry point.
You will also need to make sure that you have the gunicorn package installed in your project, 
as it is not included by default in Django. You can install it by running the following command:
Copy code
```bash
pip install gunicorn
```
In addition to the Procfile, you will also need to make sure that your 
Django project is properly configured for deployment on Heroku. 
This includes setting the correct database settings, static files settings, 
and other settings as needed. You can find more information on deploying 
Django to Heroku in the Heroku documentation: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-app-configuration
